# Chess
Chess game made in Java

This game for the moment is made to be played by two players sharing the computer. In the future I'll be implementing AI and on-line
gameplay (probably).

The player with white pieces start the match. Then a movement per player is available until one loses the match.

Once the game is over you have two options: rematch or print log (this makes a window with all the movements of the game).

Buttons jaque (check), jaque mate (checkmate) and rendirse (giveup) not supported yet.
